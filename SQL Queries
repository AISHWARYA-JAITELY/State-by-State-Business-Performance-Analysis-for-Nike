Question #6: 
When looking at the number of returned items by itself, 
it is hard to understand what number of returned items is acceptable. This is mainly caused by the fact that we don’t have a 
benchmark at the moment.
Because of that, it is valuable to add an additional metric that looks at the percentage of 
returned order items divided by the total order items, we can call this the return rate.
Reuse the query of question 5 and integrate the return rate into your table.
